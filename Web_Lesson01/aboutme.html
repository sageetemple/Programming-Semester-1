<h3><a name = "tags"></a>Tags</h3>
	<p>
	When beginning a website, you need to declare your document type such as the tag with the < symbol followed by an exclamation point and then "doctype html" and ending with a > when coding in HTML. <br/><br/>
	Then you need to insert opening and closing "html" tags with "html" within the <> symbols. All of your following information about your website will be enclosed between these opening and closing tags. <br/><br/>
	An object's scope is determined by its tags. An opening tag uses a less than and then a greater than sign, and a closing tag has a less than sign with a forward slash and then a greater than sign. <br/><br/>
	The head of a site conprises of the information which can not be accessed by the user of the site such as the title, browser info, and search engine keywords. The tag contains the word "head" within the greater than less than symbols. <br/><br/>
	The body of the site contains the site's actual content, using the word "body" within the greater then less than symbols. <br/><br/>
	Within the body of the site, paragraphs can be declared using "p" within the greater than less than symbols. <br/><br/>	
	If a line break is desired, simply use "br/" within the <> symbols where the break should occur and no closing tag is required. <br/><br/>
	If a horizontal rule is desired, using "hr/" within the <> will create a horizontal line to separate sections. As with the line break, no closing tag is needed. <br/><hr/>
	
	</p>
<h3><a name = "text"></a>Changing Text</h3>
	<p>
	You can use different tags to change the effects on your website's text. <br/><br/>
	The word "strong" within the <> makes the text between the opening and closing tags bold. <br/><br/>
	Using "em" within the <> will italicize the text between the opening and closing "em" tags. <br/><hr/>
	</p>
<h3><a name = "links"></a>Adding Links</h3>
	<p>
	In order to add links, the anchor tag is used. The anchor tag is "a" within the <>. In order to link to another site, follow the "a" of the opening tag with "href =" and then the link to the site before closing the tag with a >. <br/><br/>
	However, the website user will not be able to see anything within the anchor tag. Therefore, it is useful to follow the opening tag with some text so that the user can click on that text within the website to take them to your link. Follow your text with the closing anchor tag. <br/><br/><br/>
	In order to link to different places within your website, you need to anchor a name to the <a href "#header">header</a> of the section you want to link to.<br/><br/>
	Within the opening anchor tag in your header, follow the "a" with "name = " and then a simple, unique name for the section enclosed within quotation marks.<br/><br/>
	You can now go to the top of your page and link to separate sections with a "href =" within the opening anchor tag. However, now the name for the section should be preceeded by a "#" within its quotation marks. <br/><br>
	For example: href = "#image" would link to the section named image within the page. However, again it is useful to follow the > of the opening anchor tag with an explanation, so that the user can click on that text to get to the link's location. <br/><hr/>
	</p>
<h3><a name = "header"></a>Details On Headers</h3>
	<p>
	Headers are used to title each section of your website. In order to declare a header a tag from h1 to h6 is used. <br/><br/>
	h1 within the <> denotes the largest font and should be reserved for the most important parts of the website. <br/><br/>
	On the other hand, h6 represents the smallest font. <br/><br/>
	Simply use an opening tag with either h1 through h6, followed by your text, and ended with a closing tag. <br/><hr/>
	</p>
<h3><a name = "tooltips"></a>Tool Tips</h3>
	<p>
	Tool tips allow the user to get more information about a link by hovering their mouse over the link. <br/><br/>
	Create a tool tip by following the link within the opening anchor tag with "title =" and then the text that you wish to appear within quotation marks. <br/><br/>
	For example: href = "some link" title = "A link to some website" <br/><br/>
	In this case, when hovering over the link, the text "A link to some website" will appear. <br/><hr/>
	</p>
<h3><a name = "images"></a>Adding Images</h3>
	<p>
	In order to add an image to your site, use the image tag which is just "img" within the <>. <br/><br/>
	Follow the "img" of the opening tag with a "src =" and then the name of the image within quotation marks. <br/><br/>
	For example: img src = "blah.jpg" <br/><br/>
	The image should be in the same file as your website's code. <br/><br/>
	In order to adjust the image's height, follow the image name with "height =" and then some number within quotation marks. <br/><br/>
	Adjusting the height will keep the image's aspect ratio the same. Using "width =" and then some number within quotation marks will change the width, but tends to distort the image. <br/><hr/>
	</p>
